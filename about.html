    <h1 class=about_tag>About Me</h1>
    <p class="about-bio">This about "us" is really about "<span class="saba">me</span>", my name is <span
            class="saba">Saba Zelalem</span> and I
        am the
        sole
        writer for <span class="name">Abstract Economics</span>. I am currently a senior in highschool, whos
        passionate
        about going
        into finance and running this blog
        to entertain others on the finance world.
    </p>
    <h1 class="purpose_tag">Purpose</h1>
    <p class="purpose-bio">I started <span class="name">Abstract Economics</span> because I saw a problem during my
        sophomore year of
        highschool.
        I wanted to see what the <span class="money">"finance world"</span> was like but a lot of the articles I was
        trying to read were
        <span class="trivial">outdated</span>
        or <span class="trivial">hard to read</span>, they used words that were meant for people who were already
        heavily invested in
        <span class="money">finance</span>.
        So that's where <span class="name">Abstract Economics</span> comes in. It breaks down recent topics in
        <span class="money">finance</span> and tries to explain
        them
        in a concise beginner friendly way so that anyone who's interested in finance can explore.
